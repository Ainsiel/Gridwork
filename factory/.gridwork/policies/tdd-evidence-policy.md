# TDD Evidence Policy

## Required Evidence

```text
red_phase = required
green_phase = required
refactor_phase = required_when_refactor_performed
behavior_test_preferred = true

tracer_bullet_for_vertical_slice = recommended
```

## Blocking Conditions

- No approved work order.
- No clear red phase.
- Unknown or non-allowlisted test command.
- Missing acceptance criteria.
- Scope change without approval.

## Verification Decision

If red or green evidence is missing, the verifier should use:

```text
decision = needs_more_evidence
```
